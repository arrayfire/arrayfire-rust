/// Homography estimation
///
/// Homography estimation find a perspective transform between two sets of 2D points.
/// Currently, two methods are supported for the estimation, RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus)
/// and LMedS (Least Median of Squares). Both methods work by randomly selecting a subset
/// of 4 points of the set of source points, computing the eigenvectors of that set and
/// finding the perspective transform. The process is repeated several times, a maximum of
/// times given by the value passed to the iterations arguments for RANSAC (for the CPU
/// backend, usually less than that, depending on the quality of the dataset, but for CUDA
/// and OpenCL backends the transformation will be computed exactly the amount of times
/// passed via the iterations parameter), the returned value is the one that matches the
/// best number of inliers, which are all of the points that fall within a maximum L2
/// distance from the value passed to the inlier_thr argument.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `x_src` is the x coordinates of the source points.
/// - `y_src` is the y coordinates of the source points.
/// - `x_dst` is the x coordinates of the destination points.
/// - `y_dst` is the y coordinates of the destination points.
/// - `htype` can be AF_HOMOGRAPHY_RANSAC, for which a RANdom SAmple Consensus will be used to evaluate the homography quality (e.g., number of inliers), or AF_HOMOGRAPHY_LMEDS, which will use Least Median of Squares method to evaluate homography quality
/// - `inlier_thr` - if htype is AF_HOMOGRAPHY_RANSAC, this parameter will five the maximum L2-distance for a point to be considered an inlier.
/// - `iterations` is the maximum number of iterations when htype is AF_HOMOGRAPHY_RANSAC and backend is CPU,if backend is CUDA or OpenCL, iterations is the total number of iterations, an iteration is a selection of 4 random points for which the homography is estimated and evaluated for number of inliers.
/// - `otype` is the array type for the homography output.
///
/// # Return Values
///
/// Returns a tuple of Array and int.
///
/// - `H` is a 3x3 array containing the estimated homography.
/// - `inliers` is the number of inliers that the homography was estimated to comprise, in the case that htype is AF_HOMOGRAPHY_RANSAC, a higher inlier_thr value will increase the estimated inliers. Note that if the number of inliers is too low, it is likely that a bad homography will be returned.
