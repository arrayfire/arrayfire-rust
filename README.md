[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) is a high performance library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. It enables users to write scientific computing code that is portable across CUDA, OpenCL and CPU devices. This project provides Rust bindings for the ArrayFire library. Given below table shows the rust bindings compatability with ArrayFire.  If you find any bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/issues).

| ArrayFire Upstream | Rust Crate |
|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| 3.3.x | 3.3.x |
| 3.4.x | 3.4.x |

Only, Major & Minor version numbers need to match.

## Documentation

You can find the most recent updated documentation [here](http://arrayfire.github.io/arrayfire-rust/arrayfire/index.html).

## Supported platforms

Linux, Windows and OSX. Rust 1.15.1 or higher is required.

## Use from Crates.io [![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/arrayfire)](https://crates.io/crates/arrayfire)

To use the rust bindings for ArrayFire from crates.io, the following requirements are to be met
first.

1. [Download and install ArrayFire binaries](https://arrayfire.com/download) based on your operating
   system.
2. Set the evironment variable `AF_PATH` to point to ArrayFire installation root folder.
3. Make sure you add the path to library files to your path environment variables.
    - On Linux & OSX: do `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$AF_PATH/lib`
    - On Windows: Add `%AF_PATH%\lib` to your PATH environment variable.
4. Add `arrayfire = "3.4.3"` to the dependencies section of your project's Cargo.toml file - 3.4.3
   is the lastest version of crate.

Once step (4) is over, you should be able to use ArrayFire in your Rust project. If you find any bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/issues).

## Build from Source

Edit [build.conf](build.conf) to modify the build flags. The structure is a simple JSON blob. Currently Rust does not allow key:value pairs to be passed from the CLI. To use an existing ArrayFire installation modify the first three JSON values. You can install ArrayFire using one of the following two ways.

- [Download and install binaries](https://arrayfire.com/download)
- [Build and install from source](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)

To build arrayfire submodule available in the rust wrapper, you have to do the following.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build
```
 This is recommended way to build Rust wrapper since the submodule points to the most compatible version of ArrayFire the Rust wrapper has been tested with. You can find the ArrayFire dependencies below.

- [Linux dependencies](http://www.arrayfire.com/docs/using_on_linux.htm)
- [OSX dependencies](http://www.arrayfire.com/docs/using_on_osx.htm)

## Example

```rust
let num_rows: u64 = 5;
let num_cols: u64 = 3;
let dims = Dim4::new(&[num_rows, num_cols, 1, 1]);
let a = randu::<f32>(dims);
af_print!("Create a 5-by-3 matrix of random floats on the GPU", a);
```

### Sample output

```bash
~/p/arrayfire_rust> cargo run --example helloworld
...
Create a 5-by-3 matrix of random floats on the GPU
[5 3 1 1]
    0.7402     0.4464     0.7762
    0.9210     0.6673     0.2948
    0.0390     0.1099     0.7140
    0.9690     0.4702     0.3585
    0.9251     0.5132     0.6814
...
```
